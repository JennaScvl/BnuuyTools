# BnuuyTools
A collection of tools for manipulating Skinned Meshes from within the Unity editor

Many of these instantiate meshes and materials. Make sure that before you use the MeshSaver to save a copy of the instanced mesh to an asset file once you've finished manipulating your skinned mesh. Otherwise the mesh won't save to prefabs, and it won't upload properly to VRChat.
